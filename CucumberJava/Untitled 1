Configuration Done
Now what 
We need certain pre-conditions there that who will enter the URL? Who will Launch the browser?
 - In that case we have to create one Hook file here - Application Hooks we have to create - AppHooks package -
 Inside it create ApplicationHooks class, It is same like as Base test class in TestNG - Pre-Annotations & Post-Annotations
 Pre-Condition is that Launch the browser - It is Hooks responsibility - Check ApplicationHooks class for more details
 - Next we have to write / Create Pages & have to call those pages in Step def classes.
 - Inside the Login Page we have to maintain 3 Locators
   1) By Locators - We will use Encapsulation Concept here, Locators will be Private & Actions will be public
   2) One Constructor
   3) We have to create Page Actions - Actions will be public
  VIP Each class will have private WebDriver reference.
